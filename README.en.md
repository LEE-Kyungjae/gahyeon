Gahyeon is an open-source project for building a real-time AI character that can
remember, listen, speak, and act autonomously. A standalone Core owns conversation
and memory, while Discord, Desktop, and Unreal connect through replaceable adapters.

The goal is not to attach a 3D screen to a Discord bot. The same Gahyeon should be
able to appear as a voice assistant on Discord, a living character on Desktop, and
a high-fidelity real-time character in Unreal.

> The priority is a low-latency real-time AI character architecture, not a graphics demo.
> Reflex, Behavior, and Cognition must keep running independently while the LLM responds.

Core decides what Gahyeon says and remembers, and which emotion or action to express.
Each client presents those decisions through voice, expressions, lip sync, animation,
and rendering.

## Current status

| Area | Implementation and verification status |
|---|---|
| Core/Application | Platform-neutral Conversation, Session, Speech ports, Event, and World/Behavior boundaries |
| Headless | APIs and the persistent World run without Discord; conversation requires a configured LLM |
| Discord Adapter | Existing slash commands, text/voice conversation, music, and operations remain available |
| Desktop Client | Electron/Vue/Three.js text, microphone, audio, VRM, and World flows implemented |
| Unreal integration | WebSocket v1, reconnect, event replay, snapshots, and streaming speech implemented |
| Real-time RuntimeCore | Engine-neutral C++20 Reflex/Behavior/Cognition, VAD, speech, viseme, and World tests implemented |
| Unreal Stage | UE 5.8 source project and diagnostic pawn/camera implemented; MetaHuman and packaged-build verification remain pending |
| Looking Glass | Desktop WebXR and Unreal adapter implemented; validation on a physical Go display remains pending |
| Voice production | A low-duplication 5,000-sentence corpus is being generated, followed by QC, Piper training, and listening review |
| Character production | SDXL LoRA comparison and the source-based identity standard are complete; the final hero mesh is in production |

RuntimeCore test results are not presented as acceptance of a packaged Unreal build.
See the [acceptance evidence matrix](docs/unreal/ACCEPTANCE_STATUS.md) for automated
RT-01 through RT-13 results and the checks that still require physical hardware.

## Design principles

- Discord, Desktop, and Unreal are clients of Core.
- Core does not depend on JDA, Electron, Unreal, Spring Web, or a specific AI provider.
- The LLM chooses high-level intent, not frame-level transforms or animation files.
- Reflex, Behavior, and Cognition run concurrently on different timescales.
- Headless Behavior and World continue when no renderer is connected.
- Network callbacks never mutate Game Thread state directly.
- Durable cursors and action results are acknowledged only after persistence succeeds.
- Memory owns what Gahyeon remembers; World State owns where she is and what she is doing.

## Requirements

- Java 21
- Node.js 20 or later and npm
- Production: PostgreSQL 16
- Local tests: in-memory H2 in PostgreSQL compatibility mode
- Unreal development: Unreal Engine 5.8 (currently validated against 5.8.1) and a compatible MetaHuman plugin

## Quick start

### 1. Verify the workspace

```bash
./gradlew test
python3 scripts/verify_core_platform_boundaries.py
./scripts/test_unreal_runtime_core.sh
./scripts/verify_unreal_stage_scaffold.sh
./scripts/verify_unreal_protocol_contract.sh
./scripts/test_run_unreal_engine_gate.sh
./scripts/test_smoke_headless_core.sh

cd desktop
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
```

### 2. Run Headless Core

Headless Core runs independently without Discord, Spotify, or OpenAI credentials.
Configure credentials only when enabling the adapter or provider that consumes them.

```bash
BOT_ENABLED=false \
WEATHER_PREFETCH_ENABLED=false \
GAHYEON_HEADLESS_ENABLED=true \
GAHYEON_BEHAVIOR_ENABLED=true \
TTS_ENABLED=false \
./gradlew bootRun
```

Run `./scripts/smoke_headless_core.sh` to reproduce a credential-free, Discord-disabled boot plus
health and World-revision HTTP smoke checks. Conversation readiness is expected to be `DOWN`
in this credential-free smoke while DB and World behavior are verified.
Use `GAHYEON_HEADLESS_SMOKE_MODE=jar ./scripts/smoke_headless_core.sh` to verify the
packaged release JAR instead of Gradle `bootRun`.
On a slow development machine, set `GAHYEON_HEADLESS_SMOKE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` within 30–900 seconds.
Run `./scripts/smoke_headless_container.sh` to verify the actual Docker-image boundary.
It disables Discord in a temporary container, checks health and a World revision update,
then removes only the container it created.

The default API root is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api`. Without a client token, client APIs
accept loopback traffic only.

### 3. Run the Desktop development client

In another terminal:

```bash
cd desktop
npm ci
GAHYEON_CORE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/api npm run dev
```

For a remote Core, configure the same high-entropy `GAHYEON_CLIENT_TOKEN` on both sides.
See [`desktop/.env.example`](desktop/.env.example) for VRM/VRMA and environment assets.

### 4. Enable LLM conversation

```bash
GAHYEON_AGENT_PROVIDER=openai \
AGENT_API_KEY='<key>' \
AGENT_BASE_URL='https://openrouter.ai/api' \
AGENT_MODEL='<model>' \
GAHYEON_HEADLESS_ENABLED=true \
BOT_ENABLED=false \
./gradlew bootRun
```

Do not enable `GAHYEON_AGENT_TOOL_SAFE_STREAMING_ENABLED` until the chosen provider/model
has been verified to keep tool calls separate from speakable text.

## Discord compatibility adapter

```bash
BOT_ENABLED=true \
TOKEN='<discord-token>' \
APPLICATION_ID='<application-id>' \
GAHYEON_AGENT_PROVIDER=openai \
AGENT_API_KEY='<key>' \
./gradlew bootRun
```

The existing `/설정`, `/가현아`, leave, music, and operations slash-command paths remain.
Voice conversation uses `TEN VAD → STT → Conversation → TTS`; Conversation and Speech
domain code does not reference Discord objects.

With `BOT_ENABLED=true`, a missing/rejected Discord token or initialization failure keeps the
application process alive but makes `/api/health` and the Actuator Discord health fail closed as
`FAILED`/DOWN. Only a Blue/Green follower legitimately waiting for the PostgreSQL advisory lock is
`STANDBY`/UP; `BOT_ENABLED=false` is the explicit `DISABLED`/UP state.

## Unreal Stage

The Backend WebSocket adapter and C++20 RuntimeCore are ready but disabled by default.
They must not be enabled in production before UE 5.8 Editor and packaged-build validation.

Authoritative gate on a development machine with UE 5.8 installed:

```bash
GAHYEON_UE_ROOT="/path/to/UE_5.8" ./scripts/run_unreal_engine_gate.sh
```

On the GTX 1660 Ti Windows authoring machine, validate the canonical Stage first:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_unreal_engine_gate.ps1 -UnrealRoot "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.8"
```

After the Editor gate, add `-Package` to build and seal the packaged Development output.
Run, aggregate, and verify the packaged ten-minute measurement with:

```powershell
.\scripts\run_desktop_realtime_acceptance.ps1 `
  -PackagedRoot "C:\gahyeon-package" `
  -EvidenceRoot "C:\gahyeon-evidence\desktop-0001"
```

## Naming and compatibility

The official product, character, and architecture name is **Gahyeon**. The
`com.gahyeonbot` Java package, existing database/container names, GHCR path, and a few
service-file identifiers retain `gahyeonbot` as legacy operational identifiers. They do
not represent the current product name and must not be bulk-renamed before a coordinated
repository and deployment migration.

## Security and assets

Do not commit secrets, source voice recordings, training checkpoints, or licensed
VRM/VRMA/MetaHuman/environment assets to Git or container images. Use deployment secrets
and separate artifact storage.

SDXL outputs and generated drafts are not canonical facial evidence. Character identity authority
is the checksum-bound pack of user originals; inferred regions and approval state of generated G1
sheets remain recorded in a separate manifest.
